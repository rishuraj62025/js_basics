javascript is synchronous and single threaded  , it is default behaviour of js

js single threaded hai pr wo slow nhi hai , kyonki js engine single nhi milta hai wo runtime environment mein hi milta hai
jaise nodejs, dino etc

Execution Context :
            execute one line of code at a time
            (each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing)


Blocking code        vs        Non Blocking code
     |                               |
block the flow of program      Does not block execution
     |                               |
Read file sync                  Read file Async

blocking and Non blocking code , both are good, depends on use cases.
